# Ethereum Protocol Studies

Ethereum Protocol Studies (EPS) is a learning community formed to gather knowledge and educate itself about the Ethereum protocol. 

The protocol evolves and grows fast, it's always changing infinite garden. To sustain its credible neutrality, this pace should be reflected in the community as well. Various communities using, building or living on Ethereum need be able to learn and become involved also in the core protocol. The complexity of the architecture, codebases and dynamic development with scattered resources can discourage many talented people in participating on the core level. EPS aims to bridge the gap by introducing a curriculum focused on all parts of the Ethereum stack & roadmap and gathering people interested in diving into it. 

## Program Structure

EPS is an open 10 week long study program divided into 2 phases. 

The first half is dedicated to general understanding of protocol internals, its architecture and basic concepts. The second part offers 2 different tracks - development and research. Presentations in each track offer deeper dive into specific topics within the R&D domain.  

Each webinar will be led by an expert in the field, come with pre-meeting reading material (to get you familiar with the topic and terminology) as well as a post-meeting activity (to strengthen and solidify your understanding), like quizzes, coding activities, or forum assignments.

## Participate

The first instance of EPS is starting in February 2024. It's completely open and permissionlesss and it's only up to participant how they want to approach it. Whether you want to learn as much as possible, focus only on certain topics or share your knowledge with others, you are welcomed.

While this program is designed to act as a precursor to the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship, EPS is for anyone that is interested in learning more about the inner workings of the Ethereum Protocol. Those that have some general knowledge or use of Ethereum and/or blockchains as well as those that have some computer science, technical, or developer experience will get the most from this program.

Additionally, EPS students will collaboratively develop a comprehensive wiki, serving as an evolving knowledge base for current and future core developers. This will provide students with practical experience in contributing to open source resources, while gaining invaluable experience in documentation and community-driven development.
